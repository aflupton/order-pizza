## Description
A program for a pizza ordering application. The user enters their name and pizza preferences, and in return is quoted a price.

## Specs
- One user is required to operate the app.
- User enters their name and pizza preferences (size, meat topping, vegetable topping, and extra topping), and then presses the button marked "submit".

- For example, a user specifying a medium pizza with pepperoni, olives, and any of the extra toppings would be quoted $17.99, whereas a user specifying a large pizza with prosciutto, artichokes, and any of the extra toppings would be quoted $23.99.
